== Getting started

To open a new command-line session,
select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu of the IDE.

Run the following command to navigate to the **/home/project** directory:

```
cd /home/project
```

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git[Git repository^] and use the projects that are provided inside:

[source, role="command", subs="attributes"]
```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git
cd guide-getting-started
```


The `start` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The `finish` directory contains the finished project that you will build.
